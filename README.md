SlimBook UWP is a UWP app for Windows 10 Mobile to allow the user to access Facebook.

Small memory footprint, open source, and forever free. Not recomended for heavy users of Facebook.
***
This app has the Facebook TOP BAR locked permanently, and I've removed ads.
If anyone wants the ads added back in, I'll look into it.
***
This app is **NOT** associated in **ANY** way with Facebook, Inc.
